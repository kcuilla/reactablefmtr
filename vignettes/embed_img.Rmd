```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

Previously, if you wanted to embed images to your `{reactable}` table, you needed to upload the images to a folder and then pull the image names from that folder to your table as explained [here](https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/cookbook/cookbook.html#embed-images-1). 

Now, with `{reactablefmtr}`, there's an easier way with `embed_img()`.

## Example

To show how `embed_img()` works, we're going to build a table using data from the `{nflfastR}` package and display team logos in one of the columns of the table.

```{r}
library(reactablefmtr)
library(tidyverse)
library(nflfastR)
```

We're going to convert the chart below from the `{nflfastR}` [beginner's guide](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/beginners_guide.html) into a `{reactable}` table.

The code needed to create dataset for the chart above is outlined in the beginner's guide, which is shown below:

```{r}
## load multiple seasons
seasons <- 2015:2019
pbp <- map_df(seasons, function(x) {
  readRDS(url(
    paste0(
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/master/data/play_by_play_",
      x,
      ".rds"
    )
  ))
})

## figures with QB stats
qbs <- pbp %>%
  filter(week <= 17,!is.na(epa)) %>%
  group_by(id, name) %>%
  summarize(
    epa = mean(qb_epa),
    cpoe = mean(cpoe, na.rm = T),
    n_dropbacks = sum(pass),
    n_plays = n(),
    team = last(posteam)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(n_dropbacks > 100 & n_plays > 1000)

## join team logos to dataset
qbs <- qbs %>%
  left_join(teams_colors_logos, by = c('team' = 'team_abbr'))
```

```{r}
head(qbs)
```

Let's limit the dataset to only the columns that we need:

```{r}
qbs <- qbs %>%
  select(name, team_logo_espn, n_plays, cpoe, epa)

reactable(qbs)
```

The URLs to the team logo images are located in the `team_logo_espn` column. In order to convert the URLs into images in the table, all we need to do is use `embed_img()`: 

```{r}
reactable(qbs,
          columns = list(team_logo_espn = colDef(cell = embed_img())))
```

## Resize Image

By default, images are rendered with a size of 24px by 24px. But, if we want to increase the size, we can do so by specifying the height and width: 

```{r}
reactable(qbs,
          columns = list(team_logo_espn = colDef(cell = embed_img(
            height = "50", width = "50"
          ))))
```

## Add Label to Image

Another option within `embed_img()` is assigning a label next to the image. For example, if we didn't want a separate column for the team logos, we could combine them with the name of the player like so: 

```{r}
reactable(qbs,
          columns = list(
            team_logo_espn = colDef(cell = embed_img(qbs, label = "name")),
            name = colDef(show = FALSE) ## hide name column
          ))
```

We can finish up the table by adding data bars to the `cpoe` and `epa` columns with the `data_bars_pos_neg()` formatter:

```{r}
reactable(qbs,
          defaultPageSize = 20, ## change pagination size from 10 to 20
          columns = list(
            name = colDef(show = FALSE), ## hide name column
            team_logo_espn = colDef(cell = embed_img(
              qbs, 
              label = "name"),
              maxWidth = 175), ## set column width
            n_plays = colDef(cell = color_tiles(
              qbs,
              colors = c("#d7191c", "#ffffbf", "#1a9641"),
              number_fmt = scales::comma),
              align = "center", ## align column header
              maxWidth = 100), ## set column width
            cpoe = colDef(cell = data_bars_pos_neg(
              qbs,
              colors = c("#d7191c", "#ffffbf", "#1a9641"),
              number_fmt = scales::percent),
              align = "center"), ## align column header
            epa = colDef(cell = data_bars_pos_neg(
              qbs,
              colors = c("#d7191c", "#ffffbf", "#1a9641"),
              number_fmt = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.01)),
              align = "center") ## align column header
            ))
```
